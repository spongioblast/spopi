# Material Icon Theme — vendored vocabulary source manifest

This directory documents the pinned upstream source for the curated,
trusted-local object-icon vocabulary embedded in
`public/app/editor/file-type-icons.js`.

## Upstream

- **Project:** vscode-material-icon-theme
- **Author:** Philipp Kief (<https://github.com/PKief>)
- **License:** MIT (see `LICENSE` below)
- **Repository:** <https://github.com/vscode-material-icon-theme/vscode-material-icon-theme>
- **Pinned release tag:** v5.x (latest stable at the time of vendoring)

## What is vendored

Only a curated **whitelist** of object-icon names required by the
integrated UI modernization plan is represented, as trusted inline SVG
definitions inside `public/app/editor/file-type-icons.js`. **No upstream asset files
are copied verbatim**; the inline definitions are SPOPI-authored SVG that
reproduce the Material Icon Theme visual language (folder, source file,
config document) for object recognition. No remote URL, emoji fallback,
or Material asset is ever used for an action control.

Vendored vocabulary (resolver names): `folder`, `folder-open`,
`folder-git`, `folder-git-open`, `file`, `ts`, `js`, `python`, `json`,
`markdown`, `html`, `css`, `yaml`, `toml`, `shell`, `rust`, `image`,
`pdf`, `env`, `lock`, `config`.

## Policy

- File/Git object icons use these trusted local definitions only.
- Action controls (maximize, minimize, text-collapse, refresh-cw, etc.)
  remain the separate local monochrome registry in `public/app/ui/icons.js`
  and never reuse Material artwork.
