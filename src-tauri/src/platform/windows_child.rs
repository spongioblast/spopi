// ABOUTME: Hides the console window of a child process on Windows.
// ABOUTME: Other platforms compile this as a no-op.
//! Suppress console windows for spawned children on Windows.
//!
//! SPOPI's release build is a GUI-subsystem binary (no console of its own).
//! Windows gives every console child we spawn (git, node, npm, python, cmd)
//! a brand-new, visible console window unless the `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flag is
//! passed to that one `CreateProcess` call — the flag is per-spawn and is not
//! inherited by grandchildren. Those windows live exactly as long as the
//! child runs, which is the "several terminal windows flashing randomly"
//! reported in issue #39.
//!
//! Route every spawn through [`hide_console`] / [`hide_console_tokio`] the way
//! spawns are routed through `platform::appimage_env::scrub`, so the flag cannot be
//! forgotten at a new call site.
